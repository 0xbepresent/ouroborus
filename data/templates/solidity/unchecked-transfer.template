1. Is the return value of transfer/transferFrom being checked?
2. Does the code use SafeERC20 library for token transfers?
3. What happens if the transfer fails silently?
4. Could a failed transfer lead to accounting errors or locked funds?
5. Is this a well-known token that returns true on success, or an arbitrary token?
6. Are there any try/catch blocks handling potential failures?
